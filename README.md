Fritzing (Packaging)
====================

The Fritzing application is an Electronic Design Automation software with
a low entry barrier, suited for the needs of makers and hobbyists. It
offers a unique real-life "breadboard" view, and a parts library with
many commonly used high-level components. Fritzing makes it very easy
to communicate about circuits, as well as to turn them into PCB layouts
ready for production.
